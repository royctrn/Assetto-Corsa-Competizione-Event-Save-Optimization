## 🎯 What This Tool Does

A simple tool to **clean up your ACC career save file** by removing:
- 🔁 Duplicate events (same track + mode)
- 🚗 Duplicate team entries in car lists

It automatically:
- Detects your `1SE.json` save file (or lets you pick it manually)
- Backs up your original file
- Saves the cleaned version to your **Downloads** folder
